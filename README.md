# SilverStripe patchwork Module

Patchwork can most easily be described as "things we often use at Redema
when working with SilverStripe". In short, it is part boilerplate, part
mixed utilities, extensions and third party libraries. Theoretically
speaking it would be better to split patchwork into smaller and more
logically related modules, practically speaking it saves time to only
worry about one module (maintenance, dependencies, and so on).
